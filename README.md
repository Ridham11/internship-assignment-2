Challenges Faced

Some of the questions that involved multiple functions in a single program were slightly challenging to organize properly. For example, creating menu-driven programs like the calculator and number system functions required careful structuring.

The prime number checker (especially finding primes in a range) required proper looping logic. The number guessing game needed correct attempt handling and condition checking.

In the text analysis question, managing different operations like counting words, vowels, reversing text, and checking palindrome in one structured program required attention to detail.

Overall, the assignment helped strengthen my understanding of loops, conditionals, and functions.
